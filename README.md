Welcome to my GitHub portfolio!
I am a web developer and UX/UI designer with a passion for creating intuitive and visually appealing online experiences. On my profile, you will find a selection of my projects that showcase my skills in both areas.

Web Development
I have experience with a range of technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various frameworks such as React and Angular. I enjoy building responsive and dynamic websites that provide a seamless user experience.

UX/UI Design
I believe that good design is crucial for creating a successful product, and I enjoy using my skills to craft intuitive and visually appealing user interfaces. I have experience with design tools such as Adobe XD and Sketch, and I follow design principles and best practices to ensure that the end result is both functional and visually appealing.
